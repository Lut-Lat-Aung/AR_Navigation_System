Senior Project I (2/2024)
------------------------------------------
Project Name : AR Nav

An **Augmented Reality Indoor Navigation System** using Unity and Vuforia to guide users within buildings using AR markers, navigation lines, and arrival notifications.

---

## **Project Overview**

This project leverages Unity, Vuforia Area Targets, and QR code scanning to provide an interactive indoor navigation experience. Users can navigate between different rooms and floors of a building, guided by AR visualizations such as arrows and lines.

## **Features**

- **Floor Detection with QR Scanning**  
  Automatically detects the floor after scanning a QR code and adjusts navigation accordingly.

- **Real-Time Navigation with AR**  
  Guides the user to the selected destination using a path visualized with AR lines or arrows.

- **Arrival Notifications**  
  Displays a prompt when the user reaches the destination.

- **Dynamic Scene Switching**  
  Switches to the correct scene for the floor based on QR code input.

- **Object Freezing (Lock Functionality)**  
  Allows freezing of game objects after scanning to avoid misalignment in identical-looking environments.
